#1.struct Worker

```rust
/// A worker queue.
///
/// This is a FIFO or LIFO queue that is owned by a single thread, but other threads may steal
/// tasks from it. Task schedulers typically create a single worker queue per thread.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// A FIFO worker:
///
/// ```
/// use crossbeam_deque::{Steal, Worker};
///
/// let w = Worker::new_fifo();
/// let s = w.stealer();
///
/// w.push(1);
/// w.push(2);
/// w.push(3);
///
/// assert_eq!(s.steal(), Steal::Success(1));
/// assert_eq!(w.pop(), Some(2));
/// assert_eq!(w.pop(), Some(3));
/// ```
///
/// A LIFO worker:
///
/// ```
/// use crossbeam_deque::{Steal, Worker};
///
/// let w = Worker::new_lifo();
/// let s = w.stealer();
///
/// w.push(1);
/// w.push(2);
/// w.push(3);
///
/// assert_eq!(s.steal(), Steal::Success(1));
/// assert_eq!(w.pop(), Some(3));
/// assert_eq!(w.pop(), Some(2));
/// ```
pub struct Worker<T> {
    /// A reference to the inner representation of the queue.
    inner: Arc<CachePadded<Inner<T>>>,

    /// A copy of `inner.buffer` for quick access.
    buffer: Cell<Buffer<T>>,

    /// The flavor of the queue.
    flavor: Flavor,

    /// Indicates that the worker cannot be shared among threads.
    _marker: PhantomData<*mut ()>, // !Send + !Sync
